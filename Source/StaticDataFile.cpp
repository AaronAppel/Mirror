// #TODO Create helpers for generating and loading static data at runtime.
// As another alternative to static objects, we could determine type information
// at runtime or during a build, and then store that info in a data file for later use.
// Instead of using static types that always exist, load data, serialize, and then unload
// data to continue program execution without the extra overhead of static types.
